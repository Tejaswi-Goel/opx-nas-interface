/*
   Scenario 1.
   Attach and Detach VLAN to a Virtual-Network (with empty member list)
   ==============================================================================================
   Create Virtual-Network
   1. Bridge created in the kernel. Performed by nas-linux.
   2. Create Bridge object in the NAS-Interface and set the mode to .1Q, add to map. Performed by nas-interface
   3. Check for existence of the object in .1q map, return with failure if object doesn't exist

   Attach VLAN to Virtual-Network
   1. Set the proxy bridge_name = VLAN in the VN bridge object

   Push Virtual-Network Configuration
   1. Push the configuration on VLAN
   2. Save in the VN Bridge object in NAS-Interface

   Detach VLAN from Virtual-Network
   1. Push VLAN’s config in the kernel and in the NPU
   2. Update VN’s bridge object

   Attach another VLAN to the virtual Network
   1. Configuration failure if the VN bridge already has vlan member and VN Bridge is in .1Q mode.


   Scenario 2.
   Attach a VLANs to the Virtual-Network and change the Mode to .1D bridge
   ==============================================================================================
   Create Virtual-Network
   1. Bridge created in the kernel.
   2. Create Bridge object in the NAS-Interface and set the mode to .1Q

   Attach VLAN to Virtual-Network
   1. Set the proxy bridge_name = VLAN in the VN bridge object

   Move the VN mode to .1D
   1. Migrate VLAN’s members to VN’s bridge in the kernel
   2. Migrate VLAN’s members to the corresponding .1D bridge in the NPU.
   3. Migrate applicable VLAN’s configuration ?

   Add (P,V) member to VN
   1. Add the member to the VN’s bridge in the kernel and in the .1d bridge in the kernel.
   2. Addition of (P,V) fails if bridge is not in .1D mode.

   Detach VLAN from VN
   1. Remove VLAN’s members from the VN’s bridge.
   2. Remove VLAN’s members from .1D bridge in the NPU
   3. Add VLAN’s members in the NPU
   4. Add VLAN’s members in the kernel
   5. Re-apply VLAN’s configuration from VLAN’s bridge object in the kernel and in the NPU.

   Remove VN
   (Application can reject VN deletion is any VLAN is attached to the VN)
   1. Bridge is deleted from the kernel.
   2. If Bridge delete event comes from Kernel then remove Clean-up .1D bridge and its member in the NPU
   3. IF any VLAN is attached then restore its members in the kernel and in the NPU by creating VLAN and adding member to the VLAN.  No need to support initially.


   Scenario 3.
   Attach a VLAN to the Virtual-Network and Change the mode to .1D to .1Q
   ==============================================================================================
   Create Virtual-Network
   1. Bridge created in the kernel.
   2. Create Bridge object in the NAS-Interface and set the mode to .1Q

   Attach VLAN to Virtual-Network
   1. Set the proxy bridge_name = VLAN in the VN bridge object

   Move the VN mode to .1D
   1. Migrate VLAN’s members to VN’s bridge in the kernel
   2. Migrate VLAN’s members to the corresponding .1D bridge in the NPU.
   3. Migrate applicable VLAN’s configuration ?

Add (P,V) member to VN
1. Add the member to the VN’s bridge in the kernel and in the .1d bridge in the kernel.

Delete (P,V) member from the VN
1. Delete the member from kernel and from the .1D bridge

Move the VN mode to the .1Q
1. Since there is only one VLAN attached
2. Create VLAN in the NPU and migrate all members to the VLAN and delete .1D bridge.

Detach VLAN from VN
1. Remove VLAN’s members from the VN’s bridge.
2. Remove VLAN’s members from .1D bridge in the NPU if bridge mode is .1D.
3. Add VLAN’s members in the NPU
4. Add VLAN’s members in the kernel if members are not part of the VLAN bridge.
5. Re-apply VLAN’s configuration from VLAN’s bridge object in the kernel (member_move == true) and in the NPU.
